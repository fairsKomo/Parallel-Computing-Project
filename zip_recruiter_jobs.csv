 Ambrook's mission is to make sustainability profitable for family\\-run businesses. 
 

  



 In the face of historic heat waves, drought, flooding, supply chain disruptions, water shortages, and pollution, climate impacts are intensifying across industrial America: from farmers facing crop losses, to truckers navigating fuel volatility, to contractors managing material shortages. Evidence shows sustainable practice upgrades deliver financial returns \\- from water\\-efficient irrigation to fuel\\-efficient fleets \\- but these changes require significant upfront capital and a clear proof of return\\-on\\-investment to owner\\-operators facing tight cashflows and razor\\-thin margins already. With data scattered across paper records and outdated systems, operators struggle to forecast whether a practice change will improve their bottom line \\- let alone prove business health to lenders and other funders. 
 

  



 Ambrook is solving this chicken\\-and\\-egg problem by re\\-architecting the financial data layer of America's independent businesses. We're replacing unruly paperwork and expensive, archaic tools with an affordable accounting, banking and payments platform that helps operators understand their numbers and access capital for sustainable transitions.
 

  



 Ambrook customers are our economy's historic backbone and a manifestation of the American Dream. Done right, both financial and environmental sustainability enables these entities to stay independent and resilient in the face of climate\\-driven volatility. 
 

  



 We're a Series A startup backed by top investors (Thrive Capital, Homebrew, Designer Fund, BoxGroup, and more) and are looking for early team members who are looking to untangle the knotted intersection between American industry and climate.
